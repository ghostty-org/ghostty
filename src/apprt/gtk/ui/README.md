# GTK UI files

This directory is for storing GTK resource definitions. All resource definitions
_must_ start as GTK blueprint `.blp` files. GTK resource definitions are then
generated by `blueprint-compiler` at compile time. A CI job ensures that `.blp`
files are valid and properly formatted.

Blueprint files should be stored in directories that represent the minimum
Adwaita version needed to use that resource. Blueprint files should also be
formatted using `blueprint-compiler format` as well to ensure consistency
(formatting will be checked in CI as well).

Blueprints can be formatted and compiled into resource definitions by running
this command from the root of the source tree:

```
nix run .#compile-blueprints
```

Currently `blueprint-compiler` 0.16.0 is required to compile Blueprint files.
