# Slow Scroll (DECSCLM)

<VTMode value={4} />

Enable slow or smooth scrolling.

Typically, slow scrolling will scroll line by line when using scroll
functions (arrow keys, scrollbar, etc.). With this disabling, scrolling
jumps by more lines. This is purely up to the terminal to implement how it
sees fit.
