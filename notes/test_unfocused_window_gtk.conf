# Test Configuration for Unfocused Window Opacity (GTK/Linux)
#
# This configuration file can be used to test the unfocused-window-opacity
# feature on Linux with the GTK build of Ghostty.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to ~/.config/ghostty/config
#   2. Launch Ghostty
#   3. Click to another application to see the dimming effect
#   4. Click back to Ghostty to see it return to normal
#   5. Try different opacity and fill values below

# ==============================================================================
# UNFOCUSED WINDOW OPACITY
# ==============================================================================

# The opacity level when the window loses focus
# Range: 0.15 to 1.0
# - 1.0 = fully opaque (no dimming) - DEFAULT
# - 0.7 = 30% dimming (subtle)
# - 0.5 = 50% dimming (moderate)
# - 0.3 = 70% dimming (strong)
# - 0.15 = 85% dimming (very strong)
#
# Values outside this range will be clamped automatically.
unfocused-window-opacity = 0.7

# The color of the dimming overlay
# Defaults to the background color if not set
# Can be specified as:
# - Hex: #RRGGBB or RRGGBB
# - Named X11 color
#
# Examples:
# unfocused-window-fill = #000000  # Black (default-like)
# unfocused-window-fill = #001144  # Dark blue tint
# unfocused-window-fill = #440000  # Dark red tint
unfocused-window-fill = #000000

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: UNFOCUSED SPLIT OPACITY (for comparison)
# ==============================================================================

# You can also test how window dimming interacts with split dimming
# Uncomment these to see both effects:

# unfocused-split-opacity = 0.7
# unfocused-split-fill = #222222

# ==============================================================================
# TESTING SCENARIOS
# ==============================================================================

# 1. Basic dimming test:
#    - Set unfocused-window-opacity = 0.5
#    - Click away from Ghostty
#    - Window should appear 50% dimmed
#
# 2. No dimming (disabled):
#    - Set unfocused-window-opacity = 1.0
#    - Click away from Ghostty
#    - Window should NOT dim at all
#
# 3. Custom color test:
#    - Set unfocused-window-opacity = 0.3
#    - Set unfocused-window-fill = #000088
#    - Click away from Ghostty
#    - Window should have a dark blue tint
#
# 4. Multiple windows:
#    - Open two Ghostty windows
#    - Click between them
#    - Only the unfocused window should dim
#
# 5. With splits:
#    - Enable both unfocused-window-opacity and unfocused-split-opacity
#    - Create splits (Ctrl+Shift+Enter)
#    - Click to different split
#    - Click to different window
#    - Test all combinations:
#      * Focused window, focused split: no dimming
#      * Focused window, unfocused split: only split dims
#      * Unfocused window, focused split: only window dims
#      * Unfocused window, unfocused split: both dim (stacked effect)

# ==============================================================================
# ADDITIONAL SETTINGS (optional, for better testing visibility)
# ==============================================================================

# Light theme makes dimming more visible
# theme = light

# Or use a light background color
# background = #ffffff
# foreground = #000000

# Font settings for comfortable testing
# font-family = "Monospace"
# font-size = 12
